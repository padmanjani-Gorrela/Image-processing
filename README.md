# 🖼️ Image Processing Project

Welcome to the **Image Processing Project** – a simple yet powerful application demonstrating key image processing techniques using Python and OpenCV. This project is built to showcase core computer vision operations like filtering, edge detection, enhancement, and transformations.

## 📌 Features

- Load and display images
- Apply grayscale and threshold filters
- Perform edge detection (Canny)
- Gaussian and median blurring
- Image sharpening
- Morphological operations (Erosion, Dilation)
- Rotate, crop, and resize images
- Histogram equalization

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- Python 3.10+
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
